## Description
My motivation behind making this project was to become better at Javascript and test what I have learned.

I built this project to be able see if I am capable of generating a unique password applying knowledge of what I have learned from my class. 

With the help of this project I will understand what I am good at and what I need to work at. I still need to understand and learn more about Java Script and this project will help me to build foundation towards other project.

JavaScript was challenging among HTML and CSS, from this project I learned about IF Statement, Quiery Selector and how applying all the knowleged will help me to generate a unique passcode.
